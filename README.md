# Simple

### This is a program written in C++ for practice with [Github](https://www.github.com)
This is a simple program written in C++ with the intention of learning how to use Github as a collaboration tool. I am using solely [**Sublime Text**](http://www.sublimetext.com) as my editor 
and recommend it to anyone who is programming in any language from *C++ to Markdown*. 

My [Github Account](https://gihub.com/krynnlord) is open to any who want to view this progress.
